# This is a sample Life pattern file.
# Lines that start with '#' are comments.
# The first non-blank, non-comment line should contain two numbers:
# specifying the width and height of the board.
# The second line, optional, specifies the x and y coordinates at
# which the pattern will be loaded (defaults to 0,0).
# On both lines, the separators between the numbers may be anything.
# For the pattern itself, a white space ' ' or dot '.' represents a
# dead cell, anything else represents a live cell.
# Trailing dead cells do not need to be written.

# This file creates a 4x4 board with the 'block' pattern in its center.
# Nothing interesting happens.
